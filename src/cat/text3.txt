	The cat utility reads files sequentially, writing them to the standard output.
	 The file operands are processed in command-line order.  
If fileis a single dash (`-') or absent, cat reads from the standard input.
	If file is a UNIX domain socket, cat connects to it and then reads it until EOF.
This complements the UNIX domain binding capability available in inetd(8).
