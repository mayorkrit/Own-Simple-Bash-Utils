     1	Hello everybody out there using minix -$
$
     2	I'm \f doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. This has been brewing since april, and is starting to get ready. I'd like any feedback on things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons) among other things).$
$
     3	I've \e currently ported bash(1.08) and gcc(1.40), and things seem to work. This implies that I'll get something practical within a few months, and I'd like to know what features most people would want. Any suggestions are welcome, \t but I won't promise I'll implement them :-)$
     4	Linus (torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi)$
$
     5	PS.\a Yes - it's free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs. It is NOT portable (uses 386 task switching etc), and it probably never will support anything other than AT-harddisks, as that's all I have :-(.$

     1	^IThe cat utility reads files sequentially, writing them to the standard output.$
     2	^I The file operands are processed in command-line order.  $
     3	If fileis a single dash (`-') or absent, cat reads from the standard input.$
     4	^IIf file is a UNIX domain socket, cat connects to it and then reads it until EOF.$
     5	This complements the UNIX domain binding capability available in inetd(8).$
